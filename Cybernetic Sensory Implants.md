Cybernetic optical replacements enhance the trooper’s vision, providing infrared, electromagnetic, telescopic, and laser sighting abilities that aid either in surveillance or for targeting small arms fire. Cybernetic audio implants, meanwhile, can provide enhanced auditory perception, either by extending the warrior’s range of hearing or even intercepting enemy communications.  

The range of sensory implants that exist also includes variable speech processors, chemical samplers, and so forth. Many of these are favored by specialized spies and covert agents but contribute few real benefits in an active battlefield.  

The [[Word of Blake]]’s [[Manei Domini]], once again, made the most extensive use of these special sensory implants; where a cyber-enhanced commando from any other realm might have possessed one covert sensory implant—usually swapping out a single eye or ear for the implant—the Word’s agents and scouts often crammed multiple implants into their heads, to maximize their abilities at the cost of ever again being able to see the world through natural eyes.

## Game Rules

- Infantry units whose warriors are fitted with **IR or EM optical implants**, or with **enhanced audio implants** of any kind, operate as though they possess an Inner Sphere-quality active probe with a **2-hex range**. As with standard active probes, this ability can be disrupted by hostile ECMs.  
- Infantry units whose warriors are enhanced with **laser-sight or telescopic optical implants** receive a **–1 to-hit modifier** for all weapon attacks.  
- Multiple sensory implants that provide the same benefit **will not stack**, but multiple implants that provide differing benefits (such as fitting the troopers with laser-sight optics and enhanced audio implants) will grant the unit both special abilities.

## Construction Rules

An infantry trooper can receive up to **two different implant augmentations** at a time (an abstraction that reflects either two optical replacements or an optical and audio replacement). Each augmentation adds to the unit’s per-trooper cost, accordingly.
