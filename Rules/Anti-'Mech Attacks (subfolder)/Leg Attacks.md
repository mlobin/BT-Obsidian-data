Infantry units in the same hex as a ’Mech may choose to attack its legs instead of making a standard weapon attack. Troopers climb the legs and plant explosive charges in the joints.  

### Resolution  
1. **To-Hit Roll**:  
   - Base to-hit number is the infantry’s **Anti-'Mech Skill Rating**, modified by the number of troopers (see *[[Leg Attacks Table]]*, p. 221, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  
   - Apply modifiers for target movement, terrain, and whether the ’Mech is **prone** or **immobile**.  
2. **Damage**:  
   - On a successful hit, roll on the **Front Column** of the appropriate [[’Mech Kick Location Table]] (bipedal or four-legged, see p. 147, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  
   - Apply **4 points of damage** to the rolled location.  
3. **Critical Hits**:  
   - Roll **2D6** on the *[[Determining Critical Hits Table]]*. If the result is **7 or less**, only the 4 points of damage are applied.  
4. **Aimed Shots**: If the target is **immobile**, the infantry may make an **Aimed Shot** (see p. 110, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  
5. **Vibro-Claw Manipulator**:  
   - [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]] with **one vibro-claw** inflicts **5 points of damage**.  
   - [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]] with **two vibro-claws** inflicts **6 points of damage**.
