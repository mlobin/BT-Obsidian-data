During the **Movement Phase**, a swarmed vehicle can perform erratic maneuvers to fight off the swarming unit. The vehicle must be capable of moving at **flank speed**; it is considered to be at flank speed for the turn, but can spend only its **Cruising MP** during the Movement Phase.  

All **Driving Skill Rolls** receive a **+1 modifier** while the vehicle is performing erratic maneuvers. At the end of the vehicle’s movement, its controlling player makes a **Driving Skill Roll** with a **+4 modifier** (this includes the +1 modifier already noted); this modifier drops to **+2** if the vehicle is using **VTOL MP**.  

If the roll is successful, the swarming infantry is shaken loose as if knocked off by a jumping ’Mech.
