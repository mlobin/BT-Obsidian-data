If a swarmed [[BattleMech|’Mech]] falls, the swarming infantry unit falls off the ’Mech into that hex. As with infantry shaken off by a jumping ’Mech, the infantry unit cannot move or shoot for the rest of the turn. It also takes one hit consisting of **2D6 damage points**, applied to the infantry unit as if from an infantry attack.  

A ’Mech may also intentionally drop prone (with much more force than a standard going prone move) to shake off its assailants, but doing so requires a successful **Piloting Skill Roll**. If the roll fails, the ’Mech goes prone but doesn’t dislodge the infantry. If the roll succeeds, the infantry fall off and take damage as though the ’Mech had fallen as described above; the ’Mech that drops prone takes damage as from an accidental fall as well, and the controlling player must make an additional Piloting Skill Roll to avoid pilot damage.  

If the fallen infantry unit violates the **stacking limit** of the hex, a **[[Domino Effect]]** will occur (see p. 152, [[Total Warfare|TW]]). Any infantry unit prohibited from entering the terrain into which it is knocked off is destroyed.
