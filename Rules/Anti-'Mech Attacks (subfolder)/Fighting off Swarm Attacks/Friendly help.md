A friendly **Mechanized [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]]** unit may attempt to mount a swarmed unit in order to aid in fighting off the attacking enemy infantry. The battle armor unit must make a **standard swarm attack**, with all appropriate modifiers. This includes those from the *[[Swarm Attacks Modifier Table]]* for the number of active enemy troopers swarming the friendly carrying unit versus the number of active friendly battle armor troopers attempting to mount; this modifier is applied as a negative number to the target number.  

For example, if 21 enemy conventional infantry were swarming a ’Mech and a 4-trooper friendly battle armor unit attempted to mount the ’Mech in order to aid against the swarming attack, in addition to all the standard modifiers, a **–3 modifier** (the +3 from the table, turned into a negative modifier) would be applied to the target number. If the attack succeeds, the mechanized battle armor may attack the enemy infantry directly during the **Weapon Attack Phase** of the following turn, ignoring all target movement and terrain modifiers.  

Even if the swarming enemy infantry have fewer troopers than will provide a modifier from the *[[Swarm Attacks Modifier Table]]* (for example, a conventional infantry unit with fewer than 16 active troopers), the friendly battle armor attempting to mount must still make a **standard Swarming Attack**, but no modifiers from that table are applied.
