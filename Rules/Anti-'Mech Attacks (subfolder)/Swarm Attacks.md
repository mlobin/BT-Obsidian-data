Infantry units that begin a **Weapon Attack Phase** in the same hex as an enemy [[BattleMech|’Mech]] may choose to swarm the ’Mech, rather than use their weapons or attack its legs. Swarm attacks represent the boldest and most dangerous attacks that infantry can perform against a ’Mech. A unit making a normal swarm attack rushes a ’Mech, grapples and climbs it, and then inflicts damage against the MechWarrior or the upper parts of the ’Mech in the next turn.  

Only one swarm attack can be made against a unit in a given turn.  

The base to-hit number is the attacking unit’s **Anti-’Mech Skill Rating**, modified by the number of troopers currently active in the unit (as shown on the *[[Swarm Attacks Table]]*). The more troopers, the greater the chance of success. Modify the infantry unit’s base to-hit number as normal for target **movement** and **terrain**, and if the ’Mech is **prone** or **immobile**.  

The swarm attack to-hit roll determines only if the infantry unit manages to gain secure footholds on the ’Mech. The infantry unit does not inflict damage on the ’Mech during either the **Weapon** or **Physical Attack Phases** of this turn.  

A swarming unit cannot make attacks against any other target other than the unit it is swarming, or Mechanized **[[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]]** being carried by the unit it is swarming. A swarming unit may end a swarming attack during any subsequent **Weapon Attack Phase**. It is then placed in the hex containing the target ’Mech with no further effects.  

**Aimed Shots**: As with leg attacks, if the target unit is **immobile**, the infantry unit may make an **Aimed Shot** (see p. 110, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  

**Magnetic Claw Manipulator**: [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]] units equipped with **magnetic claws** receive a **–1 modifier** to any swarm attack to-hit roll.  

**Prohibited Attacks**: Aerospace Units and **VTOLs** cannot be targets of swarm attacks unless they land. In addition, a unit that has been successfully swarmed cannot be the target of another swarm attack until the current attacking unit ends the swarm, is removed, or is destroyed.  

**Stacking**: While an infantry unit is swarming a target, it does not count against the **stacking limit** of the hex. However, if a swarmed ’Mech is in a hex containing two enemy units and is destroyed, the swarming infantry unit automatically violates the stacking rules if it survives. In this case, randomly determine which of the two non-swarming enemy units will be displaced using the **[[Domino Effect]]** rule (see p. 152, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  

**Mechanized Battle Armor**: If the target unit is carrying a friendly Mechanized [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]] unit using the **Mechanized Battle Armor rules** (see p. 227, [[Total Warfare|TW]]), the carrying unit can still be the target of a swarm attack, but the attacking player must apply additional to-hit modifiers based on the number of surviving troopers attacking versus the number of surviving troopers mounted on the carrying unit. See the *[[Swarm Attacks Modifier Table]]*; these modifiers are in addition to all other standard modifiers applied for such an attack.  

**Vehicles**: [[Combat Vehicle|Vehicles]] can be targets of a swarm attack; all standard modifiers as described above apply. The attacker also applies a **–2 to-hit modifier**, to reflect the inherently easier task of climbing a vehicle rather than scaling a moving [[BattleMech|’Mech]].

### Attacks Against Swarmed Units  
**Source:** [[Total Warfare]]  

Attacks against a swarmed unit may strike the swarming infantry as well. When a swarmed [[BattleMech|’Mech]] takes a hit on any torso location—or a vehicle takes one in any location—roll **1D6**. On a result of **1–4**, the infantry unit does not take damage, and the total value of the weapon damage is applied directly to the carrying unit’s location; a result of **5–6** means the swarming infantry unit is hit.  

For [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]], a randomly chosen trooper takes maximum damage before the entire swarmed unit takes damage. Any damage left after the trooper is destroyed is applied to the location hit. For conventional infantry, mark off damage as though the attack came from another infantry unit (see *Damage From Infantry Units*, p. 216, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  
### Swarm Attack Damage  
**Source:** [[Total Warfare]]  

If the swarming infantry unit stays on the ’Mech, it may make normal arm-mounted weapon attacks during the **Weapon Attack Phase** of the turn after it successfully swarmed the ’Mech. Only weapons mounted in the arms of a [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]] unit can be used in swarm attacks.  

All attacks automatically hit. The player rolls **2D6** and consults the appropriate *[[Swarm Attacks Hit Location Table]]* for a bipedal or four-legged ’Mech to determine the damage location. Swarm damage to vehicles uses a randomly determined side column of the *[[Vehicle Hit Location Table]]*.  

Damage from a swarm attack equals the attacking unit’s total non-missile, arm-mounted weapon damage potential (not counting **anti-personnel weapons**). [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]] units apply all damage to one hit location. For example, a full-strength Elemental Point equipped with small lasers inflicts a single 15-point grouping of damage on one location. An Elemental Point equipped with two small lasers would inflict 30 points of damage.  

Infantry units can continue to make weapon attacks on the ’Mech in subsequent **Weapon Attack Phases** until the ’Mech is destroyed or manages to shake off the attacking unit, or the swarming unit chooses to end its swarming attack.  

**Critical Hits**: A swarm attack may also result in one or more critical hits. In addition to determining normal damage, the player rolls once on the *Determining Critical Hits Table* (p. 124), even if no internal structure took damage in the attack. If internal structure does take damage, this may result in two or more critical hits.  

**Vibro-Claw Manipulator**: [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]] units that include troopers equipped with a single **vibro-claw** inflict **1 additional point of damage** during a swarm attack; units containing troopers equipped with two vibro-claws inflict **2 additional points of damage** during a swarm attack.  

**Conventional Infantry**: A conventional infantry unit applies its standard damage of **2-point Damage Value** groupings and applies each to a location by rolling on the *[[Swarm Attacks Hit Location Table]]* or the *Hit Location Table* for the appropriate unit type. Conventional infantry do not roll on the *[[Determining Critical Hits Table]]* unless their attack damages the target’s internal structure.  

**Mechanized Battle Armor**: If a target ’Mech or vehicle is carrying **Mechanized [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]]**, a swarming unit may choose to make standard attacks against the battle armor instead of damaging the ’Mech or vehicle. The attacker can use any or all of its weapons as though the battle armor unit were not mounted, ignoring all target movement and terrain modifiers.  

### Magnetic Claw Manipulator  
[[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]] units equipped with **magnetic claws** add a **+1 modifier** to the target unit’s **Piloting Skill Roll** for attempting to remove the battle armor.
