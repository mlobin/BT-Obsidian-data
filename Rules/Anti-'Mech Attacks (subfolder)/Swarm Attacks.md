# Swarm Attacks  
**Source:** [[Total Warfare]]  

Infantry units that begin a **Weapon Attack Phase** in the same hex as an enemy [[BattleMech|’Mech]] may choose to swarm the ’Mech, rather than use their weapons or attack its legs. Swarm attacks represent the boldest and most dangerous attacks that infantry can perform against a ’Mech. A unit making a normal swarm attack rushes a ’Mech, grapples and climbs it, and then inflicts damage against the MechWarrior or the upper parts of the ’Mech in the next turn.  

Only one swarm attack can be made against a unit in a given turn.  

The base to-hit number is the attacking unit’s **Anti-’Mech Skill Rating**, modified by the number of troopers currently active in the unit (as shown on the *[[Swarm Attacks Table]]*). The more troopers, the greater the chance of success. Modify the infantry unit’s base to-hit number as normal for target **movement** and **terrain**, and if the ’Mech is **prone** or **immobile**.  

The swarm attack to-hit roll determines only if the infantry unit manages to gain secure footholds on the ’Mech. The infantry unit does not inflict damage on the ’Mech during either the **Weapon** or **Physical Attack Phases** of this turn.  

A swarming unit cannot make attacks against any other target other than the unit it is swarming, or Mechanized **[[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]]** being carried by the unit it is swarming. A swarming unit may end a swarming attack during any subsequent **Weapon Attack Phase**. It is then placed in the hex containing the target ’Mech with no further effects.  

**Aimed Shots**: As with leg attacks, if the target unit is **immobile**, the infantry unit may make an **Aimed Shot** (see p. 110).  

**Magnetic Claw Manipulator**: [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]] units equipped with **magnetic claws** receive a **–1 modifier** to any swarm attack to-hit roll.  

**Prohibited Attacks**: Aerospace Units and **VTOLs** cannot be targets of swarm attacks unless they land. In addition, a unit that has been successfully swarmed cannot be the target of another swarm attack until the current attacking unit ends the swarm, is removed, or is destroyed.  

**Stacking**: While an infantry unit is swarming a target, it does not count against the **stacking limit** of the hex. However, if a swarmed ’Mech is in a hex containing two enemy units and is destroyed, the swarming infantry unit automatically violates the stacking rules if it survives. In this case, randomly determine which of the two non-swarming enemy units will be displaced using the **[[Domino Effect]]** rule (see p. 152, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  

**Mechanized Battle Armor**: If the target unit is carrying a friendly Mechanized [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]] unit using the **Mechanized Battle Armor rules** (see p. 227, [[Total Warfare|TW]]), the carrying unit can still be the target of a swarm attack, but the attacking player must apply additional to-hit modifiers based on the number of surviving troopers attacking versus the number of surviving troopers mounted on the carrying unit. See the *[[Swarm Attacks Modifier Table]]*; these modifiers are in addition to all other standard modifiers applied for such an attack.  

**Vehicles**: [[Combat Vehicle|Vehicles]] can be targets of a swarm attack; all standard modifiers as described above apply. The attacker also applies a **–2 to-hit modifier**, to reflect the inherently easier task of climbing a vehicle rather than scaling a moving [[BattleMech|’Mech]].
