Units armed with [[LRM]]-type weapons may fire those missiles indirectly. Indirect fire allows a unit without a direct line of sight to a target to attack that target, though a friendly unit must have a valid line of sight to the target (referred to as the **spotter**).

## Game Rules  

### Restrictions  

- An attacker with a valid LOS to a target **cannot** make an [[LRM]] indirect fire attack, even if that attack would have a better to-hit modifier.  
### Resolving the Attack  

- Resolve [[LRM]] indirect fire attacks in the turn they are launched.  
- The base to-hit number is the firing unit’s **Gunnery Skill**, modified as follows:  
#### Modifiers  

- **Range modifier** based on the range between the target and the firing unit (including minimum range modifiers).  
- **+1 for indirect fire**.  
- All standard modifiers for **target movement**.  
- All standard modifiers for **attacker movement** and a modifier for the **spotter’s movement**.  
  - Infantry have no attacker movement modifier for spotting.  
- **Terrain modifiers** based on line of sight from the spotting unit.  
  - This includes the **+1 modifier** if [[Partial Cover]] exists between the spotting unit and the target (see p. 102, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  
  - Regardless of whether partial cover shields the target from either the spotting unit or the attacking unit, Damage Value groupings from [LRM] indirect fire always strike the target and **not** the partial cover, even if they hit a leg location.  

### Spotter Mechanics  

- If the spotting unit makes **any attacks** in the same turn that it spots for another unit:  
  - Apply a **+1 modifier** to all of the spotting unit’s attacks.  
  - Apply a **+1 modifier** to the [[LRM]] indirect fire attack.  
- If the spotting unit makes **no attacks**, do not apply these additional modifiers.  
- The spotter can spot for **any number of attacking units** targeting a single **target**, but it **cannot** spot for **multiple targets**.
