Adapted from survival implant technologies perfected during the massive terraforming efforts of the Star League age, artificial filtration liver and lung implants enable those who possess them to withstand all but the most extreme hostile atmospheres and ingested toxins. During the [[Jihad]], the [[Word of Blake]] often fielded operatives with such filters as part of the forces responsible for chemical weapon attacks, but many other agencies and groups throughout history—most notably those involved in research or colonial efforts on exotic worlds—use them to survive in environments inhospitable to human life.

## Game Rules  

- Units whose warriors are equipped with filtration implants ignore any damage sustained by non-lethal chemical or gas weapons (such as tear gas), or atmospheric conditions with a Poisonous taint (see pp. 56-57, [[Tactical Operations|TO]]).  
- For atmospheres with a Caustic, Radiological, or Flammable taint, these same units suffer half the damage described, rounded down.  
- In toxic atmospheres of any type, units equipped with filtration implants treat the effects as that of a tainted atmosphere of the same type, and treat any lethal chemical weapon attacks as an atmosphere with the Poisonous taint.  
- The filtration implants described here only cover the effects of inhaled/injected taints and toxins; they do not protect against vacuum, fire, or other environmental hazards.

## Construction Rules  

- As with most implants and prosthetics, all members of any multi-person unit must possess filtration implants to receive the benefits of this device.  
- The cost for the filtration implants apply per warrior.
