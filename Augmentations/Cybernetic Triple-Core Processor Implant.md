**Era:** [[Jihad]] (3068-3085)  
**Factions:** [[Word of Blake]]  
**Unit Types:** All  

The Triple-Core Processor (TCP) implant was a unique [[Word of Blake]] technology reserved for unit commanders, particularly those in [[BattleMech]]s or other armored units. Designed for tactical battlefield administration, the TCP synchronizes with other computers and provides a massive database of tactical, technical, and academic information accessible via thought. It is specifically compatible with direct neural interfaces, enhancing control over ’Mechs, vehicles, and other units.

## Game Rules  

### Initiative Modifiers  
- A TCP-implanted warrior provides a **+2 Initiative modifier** to their force if:  
  - They are present on the battlefield.  
  - They are interfaced with a unit via a [[Cybernetic Vehicular Direct Neural Interface|VDNI]] or [[Cybernetic Buffered VDNI|Buffered VDNI]] control system.  
- An **additional +1 Initiative modifier** applies if the unit features:  
  - A [[Cockpit Command Module]].  
  - A [[C3 Computer System|C3]] or [[Improved C3|C3i]] system.  
  - More than **3 tons of communications equipment**.  
- **Reductions to Initiative Modifier:**  
  - Subtract **1** if the TCP-equipped unit is:  
    - Shut down.  
    - Under the influence of hostile ECM or electronics-impairing effects (e.g., EMI, nuclear weapons effects).  
- **Counter-ECM Effect:**  
  - If the TCP-equipped unit has an ECM suite, it acts as counter-ECM, negating hostile ECM interference.  
  - This allows the unit to ignore the initiative penalty from hostile ECM.  

### Aimed Shot and Shutdown-Avoidance  
- TCP-implanted warriors with a VDNI control system may **execute aimed shots** as if the unit is equipped with a [[Targeting Computer]].  
  - If the unit already has a targeting computer, apply an **additional –1 modifier** to aimed shots.  
- TCP-implanted MechWarriors and fighter pilots **automatically succeed** at shutdown-avoidance checks for extreme heat, except for “automatic shutdown” conditions.  

### Stacking and Limitations  
- The Initiative modifier provided by a TCP-implanted warrior applies **only once** per force, regardless of the number of TCP-implanted warriors present.  
- The modifier may stack with other initiative modifiers from other sources.  

## Construction Rules  
- Only the **commander or pilot** of a unit requires a TCP implant to gain its benefits.  
- Only **one TCP implant** is required per warrior.  
- A warrior may possess **only one TCP implant**.
