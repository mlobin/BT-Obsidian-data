The toxin effuser takes the basic approach of the [[Cybernetic Gas Effuser, Pheromone|pheromone effuser]], but makes it far more deadly by enabling the operative to exhale poisonous chemicals instead of emotion-clouding chemicals. Also developed originally for the [[Manei Domini]], this implant was adopted mainly by augmented [[Capellan Confederation|Capellan]] and [[Magistracy of Canopus|Canopian]] agents in the aftermath of the [[Jihad]].

## Game Rules  

- The toxin effuser uses the same rules as the [[Cybernetic Gas Effuser, Pheromone|pheromone effuser]], but instead of applying a persistent skill modifier, toxin effusers deliver **0.25 points of damage per attacking trooper** to the targeted infantry unit on a successful attack.  
- These effects are negated if the target is prepared for hostile environment combat or chemical warfare.  
- Note that even though toxin effusers are technically point-blank weapons on the tactical scale, they are also area-effect weapons due to their dispersed nature as a gaseous weapon. Thus, no range modifier applies when executing a toxin effuser attack.  
- Toxin effusers have no effect on non-conventional infantry units.

## Construction Rules  

- Once again, all members of the infantry unit must receive a toxin effuser implant to employ this ability.
