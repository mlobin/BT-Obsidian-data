Enhanced Imaging Game Rules
To achieve the full effects of enhanced imaging technology, the unit piloted by the warrior must be equipped with an EI interface (also known as an EI display system). This item adds no appreciable weight to the unit (as a few other control systems are removed in the process). A unit equipped with an EI interface may be piloted by a warrior with or without the EI implants, but EI implants cannot be used effectively without the interface.
ProtoMechs and units with a Clan [[Machina Domini]] interface rely on EI technology for operation, and thus always feature an EI-based control system. Such units cannot be operated by warriors without EI implants. (See Inner Sphere ProtoMech Interface, p. 102, [[Interstellar Operations|IO]], for an exception.)
When a battle armor or ’Mech unit with an EI interface is operated by a warrior without active EI neural implants, the unit functions per its normal rules without modification.
When a unit with an EI interface is operated by a warrior with active EI implants, the following rules apply:
• All Piloting Skill rolls required for the EI-equipped unit receives a –1 target number modifier. This includes checks made for physical attacks, as well as anti-’Mech attacks by EI-equipped battle armor.
• All to-hit modifiers imposed on an EI-equipped unit making weapon attacks through woods, jungle, or smoke hexes are reduced by 1 point (to a minimum modifier of +1) per hex.
• All combat modifiers for darkness are ignored by the EI-equipped unit.
• ’Mech units equipped with EI may make aimed shots as if equipped with a targeting computer (see p. 143, TW), but must apply an additional +2 to-hit modifier when making an aimed shot attack. If the EI-equipped unit possesses a functioning targeting computer as well, this additional +2 modifier is replaced by a –1 to-hit modifier instead.
• Any time an EI-equipped ’Mech unit suffers damage to its internal structure, its controlling player must roll 2D6 against a target number of 7. If this roll fails, the warrior will suffer 1 point of pilot damage, and must make a consciousness check accordingly.
• A critical hit to an EI-equipped ’Mech’s sensors will disable the enhanced imaging system, negating these benefits in addition to applying the normal effects for damaged sensors.
• A ’Mech’s EI interface can be shut down during the End Phase of any game turn. A shut down EI interface will deactivate the system’s benefits, but will also protect the pilot from the negative effects of EI use in combat. (ProtoMech EI interfaces cannot be shut down, nor can Clan [[Machina Domini]] interfaces.) 
• As long as the EI-equipped unit has not suffered sensor damage, it will receive the additional benefits of an active probe with a 1-hex detection range, even if the EI interface is shut down, or being operated by a pilot who lacks EI neural implants. This includes the special optional abilities described in [[Tactical Operations]] (see p. 99, [[Tactical Operations|TO]]). This special ability is susceptible to interference from hostile ECM as normal. If the unit already possesses an active probe of any type, this ability grants no additional effects.
• For full rules on the Clan Machina Domini system and its effects, see [[Machina Domini]] Interface (pp. 116, [[Interstellar Operations|IO]]).


Enhanced Imaging Construction Rules
The EI interface (also known as an EI display system) may be installed in the cockpit of any BattleMech or battle armor unit built using a Clan technology base at no cost in weight or space, but will slightly increase the monetary cost of those units (see Costs, pp. 184-189, [[Interstellar Operations|IO]]). EI interfaces are installed automatically in all ProtoMech cockpits, and thus do not change the existing costs, weight, or space of those systems.
Only MechWarriors and battle armor infantry troopers can be augmented with EI neural implants. These implants are only available to Clan affiliations, at an extra monetary cost that represents the resources spent on the augmentation process. Clan ProtoMech warriors, who must receive EI neural implants in order to function, do not incur any additional costs for their implantation, nor do MechWarriors who are outfitted with EI neural implants specifically to operate a Clan [[Machina Domini]] interface (see pp. 116, [[Interstellar Operations|IO]]).
To reflect the rarity of EI neural implant use (outside of ProtoMechs), even among the Clans, no more than one out of every five ’Mechs or battle armor Points in a Clan force should be augmented by EI.
