**Unit Types:** [[Infantry|CI]]  

The pheromone effuser is an insidious implant originally developed for [[Word of Blake]] [[Manei Domini]] operatives whose primary missions involved close-quarters infiltration. [[Thuggee Phansigars]] soon mimicked the device, and special operatives in the [[Capellan Confederation|Capellan]] and [[Magistracy of Canopus|Canopian]] intelligence agencies carried on its use in the decades afterward. The device dispenses a psychotropic mix of chemically-enhanced pheromones via the operative’s mouth or nostrils, which can be directed as easily as the operative can exhale. The scent enhances seduction and lowers the target’s mental and emotional defenses. While almost never seen on the battlefield, this device can affect close-quarters actions against unprotected conventional infantry.

## Game Rules  

- A conventional infantry unit comprised of troops using pheromone effusers can affect any conventional infantry unit operating in the same hex as long as the target infantry is not prepared for chemical warfare or hostile-environment combat (such as troops wearing environmental or vacuum-sealed suits).  
- This “pheromone attack” is delivered with a special Gunnery Skill check rolled separately from any other attack made by the effuser-equipped unit.  
- If a pheromone attack succeeds, the target infantry unit is impaired and suffers a +1 target modifier on all actions for the remainder of the scenario, even if the effuser-equipped unit moves away. This reflects the target troops’ troubled emotional state and general uncertainty.  
- Multiple effuser attacks will not increase this modifier.  
- Note that even though pheromone effusers are technically point-blank weapons on the tactical scale, they are also area-effect weapons due to their dispersed nature as a gaseous weapon. Thus, no range modifier applies when executing a pheromone effuser attack.

## Construction Rules  

- As with other infantry modifications, all members of the infantry unit must receive a pheromone effuser implant to employ this ability.
