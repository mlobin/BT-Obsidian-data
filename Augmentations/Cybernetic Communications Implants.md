Electronics to record, transmit, receive, or carry on two-way communication via cybernetic eyes, ears, or speech implants have been available to augmented covert operatives for centuries. On the battlefield, they have proven effective in coordinating actions at the infantry squad level. However, the increased power and range of larger military communicators and their vehicular-mounted versions make these implants only marginally more effective by comparison.

## Game Rules

Infantry units (including battle armor) equipped with cyber-communications implants are able to function in a more cohesive manner in combat. This provides the following benefits:

- **–1 target number modifier** for [[Morale]] checks (see pp. 211-213, [[Tactical Operations|TO]]).  
- **Improved indirect LRM attacks** when the augmented infantry unit is acting as a spotter (see p. 111, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  
- **Avoiding mines** when passing through minefields (see p. 207, [[Tactical Operations|TO]]).  

For **non-infantry units** using cyber-communications implants, apply a **–1 to-hit modifier** to any indirect LRM or artillery attack made in which the augmented unit is acting as the spotter.

## Construction Rules

For battlefield unit use, only **one-fourth of the members of a unit’s pilots/crew/troops** (rounded up) need to possess a cyber-communications implant. These warriors only require **one such implant each** to achieve the necessary functionality; additional implants will not improve the effects.
