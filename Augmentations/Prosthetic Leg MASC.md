**Era:** [[Jihad]] (3068-3085)  
**Factions:** [[Word of Blake]], [[Capellan Confederation]]  
**Unit Types:** [[Infantry|CI]] (Foot infantry only)  

Miniaturized from the [[Myomer Accelerator Signal Circuitry|’Mech-scale MASC]], prosthetic leg myomer accelerator signal circuitry (PL-MASC) swapped the trooper’s real legs with speed-enhanced alternatives. Favored by scouts and uncommon among shock troops, this unique modification was only effective for foot infantry units; it would not affect the speed of mounted or battle armored infantry.  

### Game Rules  
Prosthetic leg MASC gives [[Infantry|Foot Infantry]] units (and only foot infantry units) an additional **+1 Ground MP** per turn, so a standard foot infantry unit with PL-MASC may move up to **2 Ground MP** per turn, while another unit reduced by encumbering items to “move or fire” mobility will still possess **1 Ground MP** per turn and is free to make attacks in the same turn.  

Attacks against infantry units equipped with PL-MASC suffer a **+1 to-hit modifier** to account for these troopers’ improved ability to dodge and weave in combat.  

### Construction Rules  
As with other infantry-based augmentations, **all members of an infantry unit** must be equipped with PL-MASC to gain the benefits of this system. Only **one PL-MASC augmentation** may be “installed” per trooper.
