The rarest of the cyber-sensory implants used by [[Word of Blake]] [[Manei Domini]] and [[Thuggee Phansigars]], enhanced multi-modal implants consolidated even more features into each device. Extremely expensive, these enhanced implants were used only by the highest-ranking or most elite operatives.

## Game Rules

- Enhanced multi-modal sensory implants function in the same manner as multi-modal sensory implants but provide an **additional hex of active probe range** in all forms.  
  - Thus, conventional infantry units and other units without on-board probes receive active probe ability with a **3-hex range**.  
  - Armored infantry and vehicular active probe systems benefiting from enhanced multi-modal sensory implants and [[Cybernetic Vehicular Direct Neural Interface|VDNI]] links are improved by **2 hexes**.  
- All units whose warriors possess enhanced multi-modal sensory implants receive the same **–1 to-hit modifier** for weapon attacks as well.

## Construction Rules

A warrior can receive up to **two multi-modal sensory implant augmentations** at a time (an abstraction that reflects either two optical replacements or an optical and audio replacement), though doing so would be redundant for the purposes of tactical gameplay. Each augmentation adds to the unit’s per-trooper cost, accordingly.
