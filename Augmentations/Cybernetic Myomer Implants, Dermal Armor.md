**Era:** [[Clan Invasion]] through [[Jihad]] (3050-3085)  
**Factions:** [[Word of Blake]], [[Capellan Confederation]], [[Magistracy of Canopus]]  
**Unit Types:** All  

While the ability to swap out human musculature for artificial myomers was perfected in the [[Star League]] era as a means to repair serious injuries, it was not until the [[Clan Invasion]] that modern armor-enhanced myomer implants became practically available to covert operatives. Leading the way in this regard were special ops agents from the [[Capellan Confederation]] and [[Magistracy of Canopus]], alongside the [[Word of Blake]]’s [[Manei Domini]].  

Full-body myomer implants tailored for combat provide operatives with remarkable resistance to injury and a boost in physical strength. These benefits come at a cost, including excruciating implantation pain, constant headaches, heavy scarring, and physical deformations that make the implants difficult to conceal.
