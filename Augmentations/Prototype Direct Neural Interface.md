**Era:** [[Clan Invasion]] (3050-3061)  
**Factions:** [[Federated Commonwealth]]  
**Unit Types:** [[BattleMech|BM]]  

The original direct neural interface technology—and the one the [[Word of Blake]] based its perfected [[Cybernetic Vehicular Direct Neural Interface|VDNI]] upon—was first pioneered by an NAIS scientist named Burke Kale, who proposed it in 3043 as a replacement for neurohelmets. The direct interface that eventually emerged from his work was fraught with dangerous side-effects, including severe addiction to both the tech and the specialty drugs designed to mitigate the worst of its negative neurofeedback.  

Given that the technology drove Kale himself insane—with horrifying results that also exposed the project to outside factions—and given that it was proven to lead to permanent nerve damage, insanity, or even death as early as its first use, the [[Federated Commonwealth]] abandoned this research by 3055.  

### Game Rules  
Units operated by warriors using the prototype direct neural interface (DNI) receive a **–2 to-hit modifier** for Gunnery Skill checks, and a **–3 modifier** for Piloting, making this the most effective of the direct neural interface implants ever created.  

Unfortunately, the feedback of this connection is extremely sensitive. MechWarriors using prototype DNI must make a **2D6 roll** to check for pilot feedback damage any time their [[BattleMech|’Mech]] suffers damage, even if the hit does not penetrate armor. The target number to avoid pilot feedback damage from use of a prototype DNI is **6** if the hit strikes armor, increasing to **8** if the damage strikes internal structure or causes a critical hit of any kind.  

The prototype VDNI **cannot** be used to operate a [[Machina Domini]] interface, nor is it compatible with the [[ProtoMech]] interface.  

### Construction Rules  
The construction rules for prototype DNI implants—and the requisite modifications to the pilot’s [[BattleMech|’Mech]]—follow the same rules as described above for the basic [[Cybernetic Vehicular Direct Neural Interface|VDNI]] system.
