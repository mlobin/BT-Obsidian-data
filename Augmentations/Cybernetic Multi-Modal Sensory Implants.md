**Era:** Civil War and Jihad (3062-3085)  
**Factions:** [[Word of Blake]], [[Capellan Confederation]]  
**Unit Types:** [[BattleMech|BM]], [[IndustrialMech|IM]], [[Battlearmor|BA]], [[Infantry|CI]], [[Combat Vehicle|CV]], [[Support Vehicle|SV]]  

The [[Word of Blake]]’s much more sophisticated form of the cybernetic sensory implants discussed above, multi-modal implants granted their elite [[Manei Domini]] operatives the ability to combine two sensory features in the same implants, effectively “doubling up” on their capabilities in the same cranial space.  

Like most [[Manei Domini]] technologies, this was shared with the [[Capellan Confederation]] via the monstrous [[Thuggee Phansigars]], but in the wake of the Jihad, the technology lapsed once more into obscurity due to its high cost.  

A particularly useful extra feature of multi-modal sensory implants, however, was their ability to mate with the Word’s vehicular direct-neural interface ([[Cybernetic Vehicular Direct Neural Interface|VDNI]]) technology, which made it possible for even non-infantry warriors to make use of these abilities when piloting [[BattleMech|BM]]s, vehicles, and the like.

## Game Rules

- Infantry units whose warriors are fitted with **multi-modal sensory implants** receive both the **2-hex active probe ability** and the **–1 to-hit modifier** for weapon attacks described under the rules for the standard cybernetic sensory implants above.  
- While a warrior can be fitted with more than one multi-modal sensory implant, additional implants of this type offer **no added benefits**.  
- If a warrior fitted with multi-modal sensory implants also possesses a form of [[Cybernetic Vehicular Direct Neural Interface|VDNI]] (standard or [[Cybernetic Buffered VDNI|buffered]]), they can synchronize these systems with the external sensors of any [[Battlearmor|BA]], vehicle, or ’Mech that uses a [[Cybernetic Vehicular Direct Neural Interface|VDNI]]-compatible control system, and thus retain the same abilities as their conventional infantry counterparts, even when mounted.  
- If the unit being operated by these warriors also possesses an integral active probe of any kind (including [[Battlearmor|BA]] active probes, improved sensors, and vehicular systems such as the Beagle, Bloodhound, or Watchdog), the active probe range of these systems is increased by **1 more hex** due to the implants.

## Construction Rules

A warrior can receive up to **two multi-modal sensory implant augmentations** at a time (an abstraction that reflects either two optical replacements or an optical and audio replacement), though doing so would be redundant for the purposes of tactical gameplay. Each augmentation adds to the unit’s per-trooper cost, accordingly.
