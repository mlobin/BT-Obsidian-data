**Eras:** [[Civil War]] and [[Jihad]] (3062-3085)  
**Factions:** [[Word of Blake]]  
**Unit Types:** [[BattleMech|BM]], [[IndustrialMech|IM]], [[Battlearmor|BA]], [[Infantry|CI]], [[Combat Vehicle|CV]], [[Support Vehicle|SV]]  

Boosted forms of the various cyber-communication implants emerged among the [[Word of Blake]]’s [[Manei Domini|Manei]] during the Jihad. When combined with the flexibility of the Word’s enhanced multi-modal sensory implants, these augmentations actually made it possible for even a humble infantry unit to serve as part of a C3 network.

## Game Rules

Boosted cyber-communications implants function just like the base models indicated above, but also grant the unit the ability to link up with a friendly C3i network as long as the network is not full, even if the unit does not possess a C3i computer of its own.

## Construction Rules

As with the basic cyber-communications implants, only **one-fourth of the members of a unit’s pilots/crew/troops** (rounded up) need to possess a boosted cyber-communications implant to gain their battlefield benefits. Only **one such implant** is required per warrior to achieve the necessary functionality; additional implants will not improve the effects.
