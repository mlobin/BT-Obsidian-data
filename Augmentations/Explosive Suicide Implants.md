# Explosive Suicide Implants  
**Era:** Any  
**Factions:** Any  
**Unit Types:** All  

Implanted in many cases as an extreme failsafe device to avoid capture or bring potential enemies down in a defiant last stand, suicide charges implanted within the body have been available (and occasionally used) throughout the centuries, but only really peaked among the [[Manei Domini]] and [[Thuggee Phansigars]] during the dark days of the [[Jihad]]. In fact, it was reported that all Domini operatives were fitted with such devices, where they could even be remotely detonated by partners or handlers via satellite and HPG signals. Even more monstrous tales told of subjects being unwillingly implanted with similar charges and sent into battle as cannon fodder.  

Generally intended to destroy the operative sufficiently enough to not only kill the operative, but also any personal equipment that might be traced or captured by enemy agencies, most battlefield suicide charges are also designed to act as area-effect weapons as well, making it possible to take out enemy infantry and security forces in the process.  

### Game Rules  
Any unit made up of or controlled by warriors equipped with suicide implants can activate these devices during the Attack Phase of any turn. [[Infantry|Conventional Infantry]] equipped with suicide implants will also deliver an automatic “attack” against all opposing units in the same hex for every trooper they lose during the same attack.  

Because the suicide implants represent area-effect weapons, there is no to-hit number for an attack by suicide implants. For conventional infantry (or dismounted warriors with suicide implants), the damage inflicted by a detonating suicide charge is equal to **0.57 times the number of warriors who self-destruct in the same turn** (after which those warriors are marked off, eliminating the entire unit if none remain). This damage affects all other targets (and terrain) in the unit’s own hex, be they friend or foe.  

In the case of suicide implants detonated inside other units or structures, the following occurs when they are activated:  
- **Conventional Infantry/Dismounted Personnel inside a Transport Bay:** The suicide attack delivers damage to the bay in which the transported unit is located, treated as a critical hit to that transport bay within the transport unit. The damage value of the exploding infantry is then assessed against the appropriate internal structure location of the transport unit (or the rear structure/armor of the unit, if no structure is present).  
- **Battle Armor Infantry inside its Armor:** The suicide attack automatically destroys the trooper’s battlesuit, but does not affect any other targets in the area.  
- **MechWarriors and Fighter Pilots in their Cockpits:** The suicide implant destroys the unit’s cockpit systems along with the warrior himself. Apply **1 point of internal structure** to the [[BattleMech|’Mech]]’s head (or **1 point of armor damage** to the nose of the fighter) and make a roll for a critical hit in that location. Treat as complete cockpit destruction for salvage purposes. No other targets in the area are affected.  
- **Vehicle Crew inside their Vehicle:** The suicide implant automatically causes a **Crew Killed** result, and the vehicle suffers a **single point of internal structure damage** to all facings. Roll for critical hits to all locations normally. No other targets in the area are affected.  
- **Suicide Charges inside Other Aerospace Units:** For every **10 suicide charges** set off by the same unit (rounding normally), apply **1 point of Structural Integrity damage** to the aerospace unit, rolling for any critical effects normally.  
- **Suicide Charges inside Structures:** For every **2 suicide charges** set off inside a structure, subtract **1 point** from the structure’s CF.  
- **Suicide Charges inside Other Units:** For every **2 suicide charges** set off inside any other unit, apply **1 point of damage** to the unit’s internal structure in an appropriate location. If no location is specified, presume this to affect the unit’s rear-facing structure. If the unit has no internal structure, apply the damage to armor instead. Roll any applicable critical hits.  

### Construction Rules  
An augmented warrior can only be fitted with **one suicide implant**.
