A [[BattleMech|’Mech]] equipped with a **Stealth Armor System** must also mount an [[ECM Suite]].  

### Functionality  
- When the Stealth Armor System is **not engaged**, the ECM Suite functions normally.  
- When the Stealth Armor System is **engaged**, the ECM Suite continues to function normally, but the ’Mech suffers effects as if within the radius of an **enemy [[ECM Suite]]** (see p. 134).  
- If the ECM Suite is **destroyed**, the Stealth Armor System cannot function.  

### Activation  
- The player may **turn the Stealth Armor System on or off** during the **End Phase** of any turn.  
- A ’Mech may start the game with the system engaged; this must be indicated on the unit’s record sheet.  

### Effects While Engaged  
1. **Attack Modifiers**:  
   - Attacks against a ’Mech with Stealth Armor engaged receive additional to-hit modifiers:  
     - **+1** at **Medium Range**.  
     - **+2** at **Long Range**.  
2. **Secondary Targeting**:  
   - A ’Mech with Stealth Armor engaged **cannot be attacked as a secondary target** (see *Multiple Targets Modifier*, p. 109).  
3. **Heat Generation**:  
   - The Stealth Armor System generates **10 [[Heat|heat]] points per turn** while engaged.  

### Aerospace Units  
Stealth Armor has **no effect on attacks by aerospace units**.  

### Critical Hits  
[[Critical hits]] against a Stealth Armor critical slot have **no effect** and should be **re-rolled**.
