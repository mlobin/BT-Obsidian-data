An active probe only affects gameplay if players are using the **Hidden Units rules** from the **Creating Scenarios** section (see p. 256). Otherwise, the active probe has no effect, though its slot can soak up a critical hit (such a critical hit has no effect).  

Under the **Hidden Units rules**, an active probe can detect any hidden [[BattleMech|’Mech]], [[Battlearmor|Battle Armor]], or [[Combat Vehicle|vehicle]] (but not [[Infantry|Conventional Infantry]]), if at the end of a Ground Movement Phase the concealed unit lies inside the probe’s range (see **Weapons and Equipment tables**, p. 303) and line of sight would exist between the unit carrying the probe and the hidden unit (if that unit were not concealed).

An active probe **cannot detect units hidden underwater**.
