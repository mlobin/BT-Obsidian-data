An active probe only affects game play if players are using the Hidden Units rules from the Creating Scenarios section (see p. 256, [[Total Warfare|TW]]). Otherwise, the active probe has no effect, though its slot can soak up a critical hit (such a critical hit has no effect).  

Under the Hidden Units rules, an active probe can detect any hidden ’Mech, battle armor or vehicle (but not conventional infantry), if at the end of a Ground Movement Phase the concealed unit lies inside the probe’s range (see Weapons and Equipment tables, p. 303, [[Total Warfare|TW]]) and line of sight would exist between the unit carrying the probe and the hidden unit (if that unit were not concealed).  

**Water:** An active probe cannot detect units hidden underwater.
