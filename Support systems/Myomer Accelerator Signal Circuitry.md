Any [[BattleMech|’Mech]] equipped with **MASC** can activate the system as it declares which **movement mode** it will use. The player declares the use of the MASC system and immediately rolls **2D6** (before the ’Mech moves).  

### Activation Results  
On a result of **3 or higher**:  
- The ’Mech can **run** that turn at a speed equal to **double its standard Walking MP**.  

On a result of **2**:  
- The player automatically assigns **one critical hit** to each leg that has not yet been destroyed (no roll on the Crit Table is made).  
  - For a biped with both legs functioning, **two critical hits** are assigned (one to each leg).  
  - For a quadruped, **four critical hits** are assigned (one to each leg).  
- This damage is applied **before** the ’Mech moves.  
- Any speed reductions apply immediately, and the player recalculates the **Walking MP** before doubling it to determine the total MP available that turn.  

### Consecutive Use  
The player must roll **2D6** every turn the ’Mech is using MASC to determine whether the system delivers critical hits to each leg. The threshold for failure increases with consecutive use:  
- **Second consecutive turn**: A result of **4 or less** inflicts a critical hit to each leg.  
- **Third consecutive turn**: A result of **6 or less** inflicts a critical hit to each leg.  
- **Fourth consecutive turn**: A result of **10 or less** inflicts a critical hit to each leg.  
- **Fifth consecutive turn**: A critical hit is **automatically assigned** to each leg.  
### Cooldown  
For each turn in which the system is **not used**, the failure threshold is reduced by one interval, but never below **3**. For example:  
AuthorIf a player uses MASC for **three consecutive turns**, a roll of **7 or higher** is needed to avoid critical hits on the third turn.  
- If the player skips a turn, the threshold drops to **5 or higher**.  
- If the player skips two turns, the threshold returns to **3 or higher**.  

### Piloting Skill Rolls  
Any Piloting Skill Rolls resulting from critical hits are resolved **immediately**, before the ’Mech moves.  

### Critical Hits  
If the MASC slot suffers a **critical hit**, the equipment ceases to function for the remainder of the game.  
- If the critical damage occurs during the **Movement Phase (Ground)** while the ’Mech is using MASC (e.g., due to a fall), the MASC immediately stops functioning.  
- The player must **recalculate** the unit’s MP. If this results in the unit having already expended more MP than its new total, its movement ends.
