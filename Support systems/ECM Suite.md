An **ECM (Electronic Countermeasures) Suite** has an **effect radius of six hexes**, creating a “bubble” around the carrying unit. The ECM’s disruptive abilities affect **all enemy units** inside this bubble, as well as any **line of sight (LOS)** traced through the bubble. It has **no effect** on units friendly to the unit carrying the ECM.  

In the example diagram, the [[BattleMech|’Mech]] in **Hex A** is equipped with an ECM suite, which has an effect radius of six hexes (shown as the shaded area). The suite affects any enemy unit in this area or any enemy LOS traced through it. The ’Mech in **Hex B** is affected because it falls inside the effect radius. A shot from **Hex C** to **Hex D** would also be affected because LOS passes through the radius. A shot from **Hex C** to **Hex E** would **not** be affected because LOS does not pass through the radius.  

Within its effect radius, an ECM suite has the following effects on the following systems. The ECM suite **does not affect** other scanning and targeting devices, such as [[TAG (Targeting Acquisition Gear)|TAG]] and [[Targeting Computer|Targeting Computers]].  

### Affected Systems  
- [[Active Probe]]: Active probes **cannot penetrate** the ECM’s area of effect. The probing unit would notice that it is being jammed, however.  
- [[Artemis IV FCS]]: ECM **blocks the effects** of Artemis IV fire control systems. Artemis-equipped launchers may be fired as normal missiles through the ECM, but they lose the Cluster Hits Table bonus.  
- [[Narc Missile Beacon]]: Missiles equipped to home in on an attached NARC pod **lose the Cluster Hits Table bonus** for that system if the pods themselves lie within an ECM “bubble.” The NARC launcher itself (standard and iNarc) is **not affected** by ECM.  
- [[C3 Computer System|C3]] and [[Improved C3|C3i Computer]]: ECM has the effect of **“cutting off”** any C3-equipped unit from its network. If a C3 master unit is isolated from the network because it ventures inside the ECM radius, the entire portion of the network below it is effectively shut off (all units subordinate to it on the diagram on p. 132). Only those C3 units able to draw an LOS to the master unit that does **not** pass through the ECM radius can access the network. If the master unit that connects the lances of a company lies inside the ECM effect radius, the link between the lances is lost, though each lance’s network functions normally (unless the ECM also interferes with them individually).
