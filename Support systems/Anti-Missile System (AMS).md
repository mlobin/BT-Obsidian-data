An AMS automatically engages missile weapons that successfully strike within its firing arc, applying effects as follows:  

### Effects  
1. **Cluster Hit Table:**  
   – Applies a **–4 modifier** to the roll (minimum result of 2).  
2. [[Streak]] Launchers:**  
   – Treat as a roll of **11** on the Cluster Hits Table, then apply the **–4 modifier**.  
3. **Single-Missile Weapons (e.g., [[Narc Missile Beacon|NARC]]):**  
   – Roll **1D6**:  
     – **1-3:** Missile destroyed.  
     – **4-6:** Missile strikes target.  

### Activation and Ammo  
- AMS is **always active** until it runs out of ammo or is destroyed.  
- **1 shot of ammo** is expended each time it engages.  
- Only **1 AMS** can engage **1 missile weapon** per turn, even if multiple AMS cover the same arc.  

### Critical Hits  
- AMS ammo explodes for **Damage Value 2** per shot.  

### Aerospace Units  
- Roll **1D6** and subtract the result from the missile’s Attack Value before generating Damage Value groupings.  
- AMS has **no effect** against Capital Missiles.  

### Cluster Hit Table Modifiers  
- The **–4 AMS modifier** stacks with other Cluster Table modifiers (e.g., [[Narc Missile Beacon|NARC]], [[Artemis IV FCS|Artemis IV]]).
