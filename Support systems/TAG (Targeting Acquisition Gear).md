**Targeting Acquisition Gear (TAG)** designates (or “paints”) an enemy unit to be struck by another unit’s weapons.  

### TAG Activation  
- TAG to-hit rolls are made **after the end of the Movement Phase (Aerospace)** but **before the beginning of the Weapon Attack Phase**.  
- Initiative is still followed when resolving TAG attempts.  

### To-Hit Roll  
- Calculate the to-hit number as for a **standard weapon attack**.  
- Unlike **spotting for indirect LRM fire** (see *LRM Indirect Fire*, p. 111), a unit can use TAG to spot and make a weapon attack **without** additional to-hit penalties.  

### Successful TAG  
- If the to-hit roll is **successful**, the target is **designated** for that turn’s Weapon Attack Phase.  
- The target unit can be designated for **any number of attacks** from any number of units using TAG.  

### Failed TAG  
- If the to-hit roll **fails**, the TAG has **no further effect**.  

### Target Restrictions  
- TAG **cannot designate infantry**, but it can target **buildings**, **hexes**, or any other valid target (see *Target*, [[Total Warfare|TW]], p. 42 in *Playing the Game*).  

### ProtoMechs  
- The five [[ProtoMech]]s of a **ProtoMech Point** may declare **different targets** for any mounted TAGs.  
  - Example: If all ProtoMechs in a Point mount TAG, they could designate **up to five different targets** in the same turn.
