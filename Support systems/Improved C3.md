The C3i computer follows the standard [[C3 Computer System|C3 computer rules]], with the following changes.  

---

## Game Rules  

### Network Structure  
- In place of a “master” C3i computer, **every unit** in an improved C3i network must mount a C3i computer.  
- Up to six units may be linked in a single C3i network.  
- Multiple networks **cannot** be linked together.  

### Network Resilience  
- Because no master computer exists in an improved C3i network, the entire network **cannot** be shut down by the loss of a single unit.  
- Only those units in the effective radius of enemy [[ECM Suite]] or whose C3i computer is destroyed by a critical hit are isolated from the network.  

### Compatibility and Limitations  
- Improved C3i computers are **not** compatible with standard C3 Masters or C3 Slaves.  
- C3i computers do **not** have the [[Target Acquisition Gear|TAG]] capability of the standard C3 Master.
