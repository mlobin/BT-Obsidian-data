## Game Rules  

### Cluster Hits Table Modifier  
- Add **+2** to the die roll when rolling on the *Cluster Hits Table* for attacks by:  
  - Standard LRM/SRM launchers.  
  - MML launchers.  
- This bonus applies only when firing Artemis-equipped missiles (see p. 140, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  

### Special Munitions  
- Artemis IV **cannot** be used with:  
  - [[Streak]] SRM munitions.  
  - [[Narc Missile Beacon]] munitions.  
- It can be used with **any other kind of special munitions**, but those munitions **do not gain any benefits** from the Artemis IV.  
- The system **may** be used with one-shot (OS) missile packs.  

### Ammunition  
- If the launcher is loaded with **normal ammo**, it can still be used but functions as a **standard launcher** (no Artemis IV bonus).  

### Critical Hits  
- If the Artemis IV system assigned to a specific launcher is destroyed, the missile launcher can still be fired as a **normal launcher** (no Artemis IV bonus).  

### LRM Indirect Fire  
- The Artemis IV system has **no effect** on LRM missiles fired [[LRM Indirect Fire|indirectly]].
