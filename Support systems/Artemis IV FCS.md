Add **+2** to the die roll when rolling on the **Cluster Hits Table** for attacks by standard [[LRM]], [[SRM]], or [[MML]] launchers using this system and firing Artemis-equipped missiles (see p. 140, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  

### Special Munitions  
Artemis IV **cannot** be used with [[Streak SRM]] or [[Narc Missile Beacon]] munitions. It can be used with any other kind of special munitions, but those munitions do not gain any benefits from the Artemis IV. The system may be used with **one-shot (OS)** missile packs.  

### Ammunition  
If the launcher is loaded with **normal ammo**, it can still be used but functions as a normal launcher.  

### Critical Hits  
If the Artemis system assigned to a specific launcher is **destroyed**, the missile launcher can still be fired as a normal launcher.  

### LRM Indirect Fire  
The Artemis system has **no effect** on LRM missiles fired [[LRM Indirect Fire|indirectly]].
