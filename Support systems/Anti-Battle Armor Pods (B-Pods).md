When a [[BattleMech|’Mech]] is targeted by [[Infantry|infantry]] for a **leg or swarm attack**, the controlling player can activate one or more B-Pods, with each activated B-Pod targeted at the same infantry unit or against multiple units at the controlling player’s discretion.  

The activation of a B-Pod occurs and is resolved **before** the leg or swarm attack to-hit roll is made, which could affect the to-hit roll (for example, troopers might be eliminated). B-Pods mounted in the **legs or center torso** can be used against **leg attacks**, while those on the **arms**, **front torsos**, or **head** can engage **swarm attacks**.  

Each B-Pod **automatically hits** and inflicts damage equivalent to a **20-point attack**—split into groups of **5-point Damage Value groupings**—against [[Battlearmor|battle armor]]. [[Infantry|Conventional infantry]] receive **1D6 points of damage** (double if in clear terrain). Swarming infantry are forced off the ’Mech as if the ’Mech had fallen (see p. 222).  

B-Pods mounted in a ’Mech’s **legs** (or any location on a [[Combat Vehicle|vehicle]]) can also be used against infantry located in the **same hex**; as above, multiple B-Pods can be used in the same turn in this fashion against the same target or against multiple targets. In such a case, the damage to a battle armor unit is equivalent to a **10-point attack**, split into **5-point Damage Value groupings**, while an attack against conventional infantry receives **1D6/2** (round down) points of damage (**1D6/3**, rounding down, against mechanized infantry), to a minimum of **1**.  

Damage from a B-Pod is **only applied to a single infantry unit**, never to multiple infantry units. B-Pods have **no effect** on any other type of unit.  

### Critical Hits  
Unexpended B-Pods that take a critical hit explode for **2 points of damage**. Expended B-Pods can still be affected by a critical hit in the same way as empty ammo bins.  

### One-Shot  
B-Pods are **single-shot weapons**, meaning they can be fired once and then cannot be used for the remainder of the game.
