If **ammo** (or any other explosive component, such as a Gauss Rifle) in a CASE-equipped location **explodes**, it damages the **internal structure** in that location. Any excess damage **dissipates**, rather than transferring to an additional internal structure location.  

If a **side torso location** loses all its internal structure due to an explosion, the corresponding arm is **blown off**, though the arm is not damaged by the explosion and can still be used as a **club** (see p. 145, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  

### Damage Transfer to CASE Locations  
If an ammo explosion transfers into a location protected by CASE, the internal structure in that location takes damage as normal. All excess damage is **dissipated**. For example, if an Inner Sphere [[BattleMech|â€™Mech]] suffers an arm ammo explosion and damage transfers to a side torso equipped with CASE, the internal structure of the side torso suffers damage as normal, and the excess damage harmlessly blows out the CASE panels.  

### Critical Hits  
Critical hits on slots occupied by CASE have **no effect** and should be **re-rolled**.
