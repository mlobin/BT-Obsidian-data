The C3 computer system can link up to twelve ’Mechs or vehicles together—utilizing a series of C3 Master and C3 Slaves—in a communications network that will share targeting information.

## Game Rules  

### C3 Network Targeting  
- To make an attack using a C3 computer network, calculate the to-hit number using the range to the target from the networked unit nearest the target with line of sight.  
- Use the firing unit’s modifiers for movement, terrain effects, minimum range, and so on.  
- A weapon attack using a C3 network must conform to standard LOS restrictions and cannot fire beyond its maximum range, though a well-placed lancemate may allow the firing unit to use the weapon’s short-range to-hit number at long range.  

### Range and Network Limits  
- The C3 network itself has no maximum range, but only units actually on the playing area can benefit from the network.  
- The C3 Master (or C3 Masters if using a company-sized network) must be on the playing area.  

### TAG and C3 Master  
- The C3 Master (but not the C3 Slaves) exactly duplicates the function of [[Target Acquisition Gear|TAG]] (see p. 142, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  

### LRM Indirect Fire  
- C3-equipped units spotting targets for or launching an LRM [[LRM Indirect Fire|indirect fire]] attack use the LRM Indirect Fire rules (see p. 111, [[Total Warfare|TW]]) and gain no benefit from a C3 network.  

### Minimum Ranges  
- Minimum range is always determined from the attacking unit to the target.  

### Variable Damage Weapons  
- The range, to determine the damage value of a Variable Damage Weapon, is always determined from the attacking unit to the target.  

### Stealth Armor Interaction  
- Armor that inflicts range modifiers against attacking units (e.g., [[Stealth Armor|Stealth Armor]], p. 142, [[Total Warfare|TW]]) does not confuse a C3 network.  
  - While such additional range modifiers apply to the nearest attacking unit, they do not apply to any other units using the network to attack.  
- However, if the target unit’s armor includes an [[ECM Suite]] system (e.g., [[Stealth Armor|Stealth Armor]]), an attacking unit must be outside the effective range of the [[ECM Suite]] or be cut off from the network.
