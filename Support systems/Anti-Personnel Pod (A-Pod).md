When [[Infantry]] units make **anti-’Mech attacks** or **point-blank shots from hiding** (see rules for *[[Anti-’Mech Attacks]]*, p. 220, and *[[Hidden Units]]*, p. 259 in *Creating Scenarios*), a [[BattleMech|’Mech]] with an A-Pod can defend itself by detonating the pod before the infantry player makes the to-hit roll.  

If the defender triggers an A-Pod, any [[Infantry|conventional infantry unit]] (friendly or enemy) in the same hex as the ’Mech takes **1D6 – 1** (minimum 1) points of damage **before resolving its own attack**. A-Pods do not affect [[Battlearmor|battle armor]].  

### Critical Hits  
Unexpended A-Pods that take a critical hit **do not explode**, but simply become inoperative. Critical hits can still affect expended A-Pods in the same way as empty ammo bins.  

### One-Shot  
A-Pods are **single-shot weapons**, meaning they can be fired once and then cannot be used for the remainder of the game.
