**Triple-Strength Myomer (TSM)** provides benefits only when a [[BattleMech|’Mech]] is **running hot**. If a ’Mech equipped with TSM ends a turn with a **heat level of 9 or higher**, the following effects take place the next turn (apply other modifiers that decrease movement, such as **heat** and **damage**, normally):  

### Effects of TSM  
1. **Movement Increase**:  
   - Increase the ’Mech’s **Walking MP by 2** and recalculate its **Running MP** (multiply the new Walking MP by **1.5**, rounding up).  
   - TSM **does not affect Jumping MP**.  

2. **Lifting Capacity**:  
   - **Double** the ’Mech’s lifting ability (see *Cargo Carriers* in *Creating Scenarios*, p. 261, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  

3. **Physical Attack Damage**:  
   - **Double** the damage for **punch**, **kick**, and **club attacks**, as well as some **physical weapon attacks** (see p. 146, [[Total Warfare|TW]]).  

### Critical Hits  
[[Critical hits]] against slots containing TSM have **no effect** and should be **re-rolled**.
