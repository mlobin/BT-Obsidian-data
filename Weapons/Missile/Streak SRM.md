A player attempting to **lock a Streak missile** on target must make a standard **to-hit roll** during the **Weapon Attack Phase** as if firing a standard [[SRM]].  

### Successful Lock  
If the to-hit roll is **successful**:  
- The player **immediately fires** their Streak SRM at the locked-on target.  
- All Streak missiles **automatically hit** (no roll on the Cluster Hits Table is required).  
- The player rolls as normal to determine **hit locations**.  

### Failed Lock  
If the to-hit roll **fails**:  
- The player **does not achieve a lock** and does not fire the SRMs.  
- No **heat** is generated by the failed attempt.  

### Roll Requirements  
The player must roll for a **targeting lock** each turn, even if a lock was achieved in the previous turn. A separate to-hit roll is required for each individual **Streak system** being fired.
